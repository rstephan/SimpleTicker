SimpleTicker
============

A portable version of the Ticker-library found in the ESP8266 Arduino Project.

This SimpleTicker uses the millis()-Function to meassure the differences in
time after which the action is triggerd. It is not the best in accuracy but portable,
so it can be used on all Arduino platfroms.

Inspired by ...
